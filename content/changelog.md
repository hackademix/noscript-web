  Clickjacket and other UI-redressing vulnerabilities: UI interaction
  with embedded objects is disabled if they're obstructed or not
  clearly visible (thanks Sirdarckcat, RSnake, Michal Zalewski and
  Matt Mastracci for inspiration and discussion)
+ "ClearClick protection" and "Opacize embedded objects" controls in
  "NoScript Options|Plugins", to enable/disable them on untrusted
  and/or trusted pages
+ Frame breaker emulation for frames where JS is disabled, controlled
  by the noscript.emulateFrameBreak about:config preference
x Fixed recursion problem with new legacy frame management
x Changed noscript.forbidIFrameContext default to 2 (allow same

v 1.8.1.7
==========================================================================
+ Specific "clickjacking" countermeasure working on non-whitelisted
  pages by default even if "Forbid IFRAME" is not checked: all plugin
  objects and frames are forcibly rendered opaque when embedding page
  is not in your whitelist. If you want to protect whitelisted pages,
  the best protection is still checking "Forbid IFRAME" together with
  "Apply these restrictions to trusted site as well" in the Plugins
  options panel (thanks Sirdarckcat for brainstorming)

v 1.8.1.6
==========================================================================
x Lowered sensibility to javascript: URLs (thanks C@rb0n for report)

x Fixed http://*.sub.domain:1234 site matching working only with "0"
  (wildcard) port (thanks t3chnomanc3r for report).
x Fixed Torbutton JS status reporting

v 1.8.1.2
==========================================================================
x Switched "HTTPS|Automatic Secure Cookie Management" off by default:
  even if all the reported login issues (especially the ebay.com one)
  have been fixed, it probably deserves more testing from opt-in
  volunteers before a general "default-on" release
+ Unsafe cookies can be handled either globally (default), or per tab
  (noscript.secureCookies.perTab)
x Fixed "force HTTPS" not working across some redirection patterns

v 1.8.1.1
==========================================================================
+ On the fly patching of bookmarklets using setTimeout() executed on

  ebay.com and other complex multi-domain sites

v 1.8.1
==========================================================================
x Fixed minor bugs in automatic fall-back for insecure cookies
x Updated localizations

v 1.8.0.7
==========================================================================
+ Panel for HTTPS-related options in the "Advanced" section
+ New Tor-friendly whitelist behaviours configurable in
  NoScript Options|Advanced|HTTPS: you can choose to apply the active
  content whitelist on HTTPS sites only, either always or just when
  a proxy is in use.
x Better "automatic" behavior for securing cookies:
  we check HTTPS response setting cookies and
  1) if host is in the noscript.secureCookiesExceptions list we let
     it pass through
  2) if host is in the noscript.secureCookiesForced list we append a
     ";Secure" flag to every non-secure cookie set by this response
  3) otherwise, we just log unsafe cookies BUT if no secure cookie
     is set, we patch all these cookies with ";Secure" like in #2.
     However, if a navigation from an encrypted to a non-encrypted
     part of the same site happens in the same tab, NoScript removes
     its ";Secure" patch to ensure compatibility. When it happens,
     this event is logged to the Error Console with an advice
     to try forcing HTTPS for this site.

v 1.8.0.6
==========================================================================
+ Changed "Forced Secure Cookies" enablement policy to per domain
  opt-in, controlled by the noscript.secureCookiesForced about:config
  preference. HTTPS sites listed in this preference get their
  Set-Cookie headers patched with the Secure flag, sites listed in
  noscript.secureCookiesException are ignored and the others have
  their non-secure cookies logged in the Error Console.
+ Experimental noscript.httpsForced about:config preference listing
  domains where HTTPS should be forced (HTTP requests are forcibly
  redirected to their HTTPS version by NoScript)

v 1.8.0.5
==========================================================================
+ Experimental "Forced Secure Cookies" feature, mitigates HTTPS
  cookie hijacking attacks (http://tinyurl.com/cookiehijack).
  Enabled by default, it can be disabled either globally, by toggling
  the noscript.secureCookies about:config preference, or for specific
  domains only, by listing them (space or comma separated) in the
  noscript.secureCookiesException about:config preference.
