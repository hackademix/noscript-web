The __NoScript Security Suite__ is [free open source software]({{ links.source }}) providing extra protection for [Firefox]({{ links.moz }}) (on Android, too!), [Chrome]({{ links.chrome }}), Edge, Brave
and other web browsers based on [Chromium]({{ links.chrome }}) or [Mozilla Gecko]({{ links.moz }}).

NoScript is a built-in foundational security component of the [Tor Browser](https://torproject.org), the top anonymity tool defending millions against surveillance and censorship.

This browser extension allows JavaScript and other active content to be executed only by trusted web sites of your choice (e.g. your online bank).

NoScript also provides the most powerful anti-XSS protection ever available in a browser.

NoScript's unique whitelist based pre-emptive script blocking approach prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known, such as Meltdown or Spectre, and even not known yet!) with __no functionality loss__:
you can enable JavaScript and other dynamic capabilities for sites you trust with a simple left-click on the NoScriSpt icon.

Staying safe has never been so easy!

Experts* will agree: __the web is really safer with NoScript!__

\* _experts endorsing NoScript, among others: __Edward Snowden__ (former CIA analyst and whistleblower against surveillance state); __Window Snyder__ (former "Chief Security Something or Other" at Mozilla); __Douglas Crockford__ (Javascript expert and creator of the JSON format); the [Sans Internet Storm Center](https://isc.sans.edu/)_
