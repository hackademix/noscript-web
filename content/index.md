NoScript is a built-in key security component of the [__Tor Browser__](https://torproject.org), the top anonymity tool defending millions against surveillance and censorship.

This browser extension allows JavaScript and other potentially __harmful content__ to be executed only by trusted web sites __of your choice__ (e.g. your online bank).

NoScript also provides the most powerful __anti-XSS protection__ ever available in a browser.

NoScript's unique __pre-emptive script blocking__ approach prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known, such as Meltdown or Spectre, and even not known yet!) with __no functionality loss__:
you can enable JavaScript and other dynamic capabilities for __sites you trust__ [with a simple click]({{ "/usage" | url }}).

Staying __safe__ has never been so __easy__!

Experts* will agree: __the web is really safer with NoScript!__

\* _experts endorsing NoScript, among others: __Edward Snowden__ (former NSA analyst and whistleblower against surveillance state); __Window Snyder__ (former top security officer at Microsoft, Square, Inc., Apple, Fastly, Intel and Mozilla Corp.); __Douglas Crockford__ (Javascript expert and creator of the JSON format); the [__Sans Internet Storm Center__](https://isc.sans.edu/)_
