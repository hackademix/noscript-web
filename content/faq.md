### Installation / Usage

#### __Why__{ #faq-no-icon } can't I see the NoScript icon anywhere in the browser?

__On Chrome/Chromium__, you most likely still need to pin NoScript to the browser toolbar. You can do it by clicking the generic extension icon there and select the NoScript entry for pinning.

Otherwise, if you're browsing in a Private/Incognito window (or you've set your browser to do it by default), please open the _Extensions Manager_ and double check you've allowed NoScript to run in Private/Incognito mode.

### Troubleshooting

#### __Why__{ #faq-forgot-settings } does NoScript forget my per-site customizations whenever I restart the browser?

This should happen only if you're browsing in a Private/Incognito window (or you've set your browser to do it by default), or if you're using the Tor Browser. In those cases, NoScript only allows temporary per-site customizations, kept in volatile memory and "forgot" when you quit the browser, in order to preserve your privacy by never saving your site-specific preferences permanently.

### Contributing

#### Is there any way to __donate__{ #faq-donate } different than Paypal?
