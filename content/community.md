### Getting help

If something about NoScript puzzles you, please read the [FAQ]({{ "/faq" | url }}) first.

You can always discuss about NoScript or seek help on this __[support forum](https://noscript.net/forum)__, where you will be welcomed by an amazing volunteer staff of very knowledgeable and friendly NoScript power users.

### Reporting issues

If you've found a bug, please [report it in the source code repository][issues] or (especially if you believe it's a __security sensitive issue__) [let the lead developer know](https://maone.net) privately: we'll try to fix it as soon as I can.

### __Contributing and reusing__{#devs}

[![NoScript Commons Library](https://noscript.net/commons-library/nscl-logo.png){.nscl-logo}][nscl]

Most of NoScript's back-end code has been retfactored out into the __[NoScript Commons Library (NSCL)][nscl]__, thanks to the [National Democratic Institute](https://www.ndi.org/)'s precious support, with the goal of improving its reusability by other privacy/security-focused browser extensions.

If you are a developer wishing to [fix an issue][issues], to contribute new code or to reuse existing NoScript (Commons Library) code, the relevant repositories are:

1. [__NoScript__ (front-end) source code repository]({{links.source}})
2. [__NoScript Commons Library__ source code repository][nscl]

### Translations

NoScript is currently localized in 28 languages, and this website is in the process to be made easier to localize, too.
If you wish to help translate NoScript in your language, please use [__this Transifex instance__](https://www.transifex.com/otf/noscript/) generously offered by the [Open Technology Fund][otf].

### Funding
Specific  NoScript development efforts have been generously supported by the [__Open Technology Fund__][otf], the [__National Democratic Institute__][ndi], the [__NLNet Foundation__][nlnet] and other institutions which value privacy, security and digital rights for everyone.
