[![NoScript Commons Library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackademix/nscl/main/nscl-logo.png){.nscl-logo}][nscl]

Most of NoScript's back-end code has been retfactored out into the __[NoScript Commons Library (NSCL)][nscl]__, thanks to the [National Democratic Institute](https://www.ndi.org/)'s precious support, with the goal of improving its reusability by other privacy/security-focused browser extensions.

If you are a developer wishing to [fix an issue][issues], to contribute new code or to reuse existing NoScript (Commons Library) code, the relevant repositories are:

1. [__NoScript__ (front-end) source code repository]({{links.source}})
2. [__NoScript Commons Library__ source code repository][nscl]
